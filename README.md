# Electronics from China

This repo is a work in progress. Me and a bunch of my discord friends on [Spacehuhn's discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/7Ay378G) all like to purchase cheap electronics from China for projects, so we figured it'd be good to make a list of stuff that we have bought for those that are just starting out and want ideas/parts for projects.<br />
All prices in Euro and USD.<br />
